# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
A software model that uses objects to manipulate data

**object** - a unorder collection of key-value pairs. A object is a instance of a class  
**instance** - a specific example of a class  
**class** - a template for creating multiple objects with same list of properties but different data values saved in it  
**this** - refers to the current object that is being executed  
Ex:  
<img width="188" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69539559/172754701-2f36da5d-4570-4e29-8dec-e29385598ed5.png">
(Refer to inheritance definition for an example of a class)  
**attribute** - information that is stored inside a class that is different for every instance  of that class(properties of a class)    
**method** - a function that perform a spceific action on a object  
**constructor** - a method that is used to create and initialize a instance of a class(predefines attributes/properties of the class)   
Ex:  
<img width="313" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69539559/163294558-928cc18a-a55b-4401-aa3b-a21debbb2757.png">  

## The 4 Principles:
* **Encapsulation** - the bundling of data, along with the methods that act on that data, into a single unit  
Ex: A class  

* **Polymorphism** - ability to call the method on different objects and each object responds in different way (take on multiple forms)  
Ex:  
<img width="344" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69539559/172285369-04577126-3e96-45d0-887e-981f75d45e60.png">    
The output of 'speak' will vary depending on which subclass is being instantiated  

* **Abstraction** - the concept that says only 'necessary' information is shown  
Ex:  
A app that performs order of operations (PEMDAS). When using the app the user does not see every step performed on the screen all they see is 
the answer or ouptut  
*The only thing that is shown/seen are the input(s) and output(s)*  

* **Inheritance** - the ability for a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class

**super** - a keyword used to call the constructor of a parent class in order to access the properties and methods  
Ex:
