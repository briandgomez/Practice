# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
A software model that uses objects instead of functions to manipulate data

**class** - a blueprint or template for creating object
(Refer to inheritance definition for an example of a class)

@import "OOP.png" {width="300px" height="300px"}

## The 4 Principles:
**Encapsulation** - the bundling of data, along with the methods that act on that data, into a single unit
Ex: A class

**Polymorphism** - the ability (usually a class) to take on multiple forms
Ex: 
@import "Polymorphism.png"
The output of 'speak' will vary depending on the input

**Abstraction** - the concept that says only 'necessary' information is shown
Ex:
A function that performs order of operations (PEMDAS)
*The only thing that is shown/seen are the input(s) and output(s)*

**Inheritance** - the ability for a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class
Ex:
@import "Inheritance.png" {width=300px}

# Unit Testing
The process of testing the smallest possible units of an application. Unit tests are part of the TDD (Test Driven Development) cycle.

**TDD** - the process of writing failing tests (Red) BEFORE writing code. After writing tests, the minimal amount of code is written in order to pass the tests (Green). Developers can then refactor the code to keep it DRY (Refactor).
**TDD also makes it easier to write code since you know /have an idea of what to write thus the code itself is simple*

**Jest** - is a testing framework (mainly used for React0

# Git
Git is a version control management system that tracks all the changes and history made to a repository

# Node
An environment that makes it easier to create web applications because it grants us access to features on a computer. This allows us to write programs on both browser and computers using 1 language.

Ex:
@import "Node.png"

# React
