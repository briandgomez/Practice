• Recursion - a method that calls itself until it no longer does
   ◇  Base case - the scenario that causes the recursive method to end
   ◇ Recursive case - the scenario that causes the method to call itself 
   ◇  Every time a method calls itself it is creating a new instance of itself and adding it to a call stack
   ◇ In order to perform recursion 2 conditions must be met:

▪ You need to perform the same action repeatedly 

▪ The problem needs to get smaller after each repetition 

• Call Stack - a data structure used to store and determine the order in which code is executed. Follow LIFO.
