* Recursion - a method that calls itself until it no longer does
   -  Base case - the scenario that causes the recursive method to end
   - Recursive case - the scenario that causes the method to continue to call itself 
   -  Every time a method calls itself it is creating a new instance of itself and adding it to the call stack
   - In order to perform recursion 2 conditions must be met:
      1. You need to perform the same action repeatedly 
      2. The problem needs to get smaller after each repetition 

* Call Stack - a data structure used to store and determine the order in which code is executed
