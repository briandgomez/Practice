# In-place reversal of linked list
This pattern reverses one node at a time starting with one variable (current) pointing to the head of the linked list, and one variable (previous) will point to the previous node that you have processed. You will then reverse the current node by pointing it to the previous before moving on to the next node. Also, you will update the variable “previous” to always point to the previous node that you have processed.
