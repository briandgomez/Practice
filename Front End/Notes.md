# React.js
A JS framework used to create single page web applications and UIs by using components.

**single page web application**  - a app that does NOT reload the entire page when a change is made. Instead it only reloads the particular section of the app where the change was made (It makes apps more efficient).  
Ex:  
<img width="383" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69539559/164130166-588bf7bb-c6a8-4a4f-a922-fc2aba643b20.png">

**component** - independent pieces of code that can be reused throughout a app (Similar to functions but instead they return HTML).  
**JSX (Javascript XML)** - syntax that allows use to write HTML in Javascript (It converts HTML to react elements).  
Ex:  
<img width="406" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69539559/166856320-1b5ecc4a-1aa0-49f6-92b8-d492c1eee656.png">  
In the example above from Y.E.R, HTML tags are used to create a search input structure while the functions are inserted inside the tags as values for the attributes. This code allows to search for movies and tv shows thanks to the functions inside these attributes.
